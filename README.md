### Component Testing

The Data Kernel app is built with functional components. The Jest framework is used to run component testing for the web app. This library was chosen as it has wide use and comes configured with the create-react-app library.

To run the testing suite locally execute the following in the console:

```node
cd data-kernel
npm run test
```
